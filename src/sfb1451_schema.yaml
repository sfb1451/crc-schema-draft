  Dataset:
    attributes:
      name:
        slot_uri: schema:name
        required: true
        description: >-
          Identifies the dataset uniquely within the scope of a CRC
          project, ie the respective project must not have two
          different datasets of the same name. The name should be
          suitable for a directory/folder name. Spaces and special
          characters should be avoided.
      title:
        slot_uri: schema:title
        required: true
        description: >-
          Title to be displayed on the catalog landing page for the
          dataset. Language must be English.
      description:
        slot_uri: schema:description
        required: true
        description: >-
          General description of the dataset. It may summarize its
          purpose, scope, content, and potential applications. If a
          long description need to be split into paragraphs, each
          paragraph can be put into a dedicated column in this
          row. Language must be English.
      crc-project:
        slot_uri: schema:ResearchProject
        required: true
        description: >-
          One or more CRC project this dataset is attributed to
          (typically the project responsible for acquisition). The
          project is identified by its CRC project code (e.g.,
          Z02). If multiple project have been involved, additional
          project codes can be given in subsequent columns, one per
          column.
      version:
        slot_uri: schema:version
        required: true
        description: >-
          A label that identifies the version of the dataset the
          catalog record is describing. If a dataset is unversioned,
          it is acceptable to state latest. Otherwise any numerical
          label (e.g., 1.2), or text label (e.g., GITSHA 7db210fb5)
          can be provided here. The version should change when the
          content of the dataset changes.
      sample[organism]:
        slot_uri: openminds:Species
        required: true
        description: >-
          Classification of organism(s) associated with, or studied
          for the dataset. One or more organisms can be given, one per
          column.  Organisms must be identified by their ID in the
          NCBI organismal taxonomy, which can be searched at
          https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/ncbitaxon.  For
          example, the identifier for human or homo sapiens is
          NCBITaxon:9606. The column value should be NCBITaxon:9606 in
          this case.
      sample[organism-part]:
        slot_uri: openminds:UBERONParcellation
        required: true
        description: >-
          Classification of organism part(s) associated with, or
          studied for the dataset. One or more organism parts can be
          given, one per column.  Organism parts must be identified by
          their ID in the Uber-anatomy ontology (UBERON), which can be
          searched at https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols4/ontologies/uberon.
          For example, the identifier for upper limb segment is
          UBERON:0008785. The column value should be UBERON:0008785 in
          this case.  The identifier for the brain is UBERON:0000955,
          but more precise definitions for individual brain structures
          are available.
      keywords:
        slot_uri: schema:keywords
        required: false
        description: >-
          Keywords describing the major topical themes of the
          dataset. Any number of keywords can be given, one keyword
          per column. Keyword aid the discoverability of a dataset.

          was published in). The DOI should preferably point to the
          dataset version described in the catalog record.

        slot_uri: schema:dateModified
        required: false
        description: >-
          Date of the last modification of the described dataset
